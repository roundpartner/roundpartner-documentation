# Team Management

<p>Teams allows you to organise your work for your fleet. By creating teams you can gain access to multiple job schedules which can be assigned to your employees of your company.</p><p>You can add and remove rounds to a team allowing you to easily organise work. If a crew member is assigned to a team they will automatically view their assigned jobs and payments on the desktop and mobile site.</p><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/f5712365bc73a0b99674d375f76cc2fc.png" style="width:696.6938775510204px;height:338px;" alt="f5712365bc73a0b99674d375f76cc2fc.png" /></p>A drop down menu will appear on the jobs, planner and payments page if a team has been created.
