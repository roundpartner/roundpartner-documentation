## Moving all Jobs
<!-- todo: rewrite content on this page -->
You can adjust the scheduled date of all jobs on the [holiday form](https://roundpartner.co.uk/booking/holiday).

On this form you can select the date you will be returning on.
After selecting the date you will see how many days your jobs will be rescheduled by.

When you submit the form, all your jobs will be moved forward by the amount of days displayed.
