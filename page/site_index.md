## Getting Started
When you first log into RoundPartner the first page you see is the dashboard. You can begin adding customers using the links found under the Quick Links widget. Add a single customer using the **Add Customer** button. If you prefer to add an entire street of customers you can use the **Add Street** button. Prospective customers can be added by pressing **Add Prospective**. Prospective customers allows you to enter an estimated job price and then convert them into a customer at a later date.
