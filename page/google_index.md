## What's currently working

Since this feature is new, we have currently limited the functionality. Below is what you can currently do:

* Add jobs booked between yesterday and tomorrow to your calendar
* Optionally add completed jobs
* Only jobs that have not been previously added are not readded to the calendar
* Jobs are currently added with spaced at 30min intervals during the day

## Examples

Below is an example of what your jobs will look like when you synchronise with Google Calendar.
