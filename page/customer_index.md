# Customers

<p>The customer list gives you an overview of all your customers. From this screen you can create a new customer or add an entire street. You can also view your prospective customers and cancelled customers. You can view the customer details by pressing the customer name.</p><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/5db4ff11bcec98dec99934e4cec095ee.png" alt="5db4ff11bcec98dec99934e4cec095ee.png" /></p>You can update or edit customer details using the icons on the right.

They will have a positive balance if they have paid in advance.<p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/a8dd0a133bc6c9d480c44486dd433d21.png" alt="a8dd0a133bc6c9d480c44486dd433d21.png" /></p><h3>Add A New Customer</h3><p>If you press the Add Customer button you will be taken to the customer creation screen. The first section asks for the customer details. These fields are optional but handy to enter them if you got the details. You can go straight to adding an address by pressing <b>Add Address</b> button.</p><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/1c7bdcae6a2ecc01ea34fb4950fa76b6.png" alt="1c7bdcae6a2ecc01ea34fb4950fa76b6.png" /></p>When you are adding an address you can use quick find to have the details automatically added. This also has the extra bonus of being able to display the location on a map. You can then press <b>Add Job</b> to continue.<p></p><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/9462dc3e47a9c4c9d1721bdde85036b2.png" alt="9462dc3e47a9c4c9d1721bdde85036b2.png" /></p><h3>Adding Job</h3><p></p><p>There are a few fields to complete when adding a new job. First start by setting the job type. This can be anything you want such as Window Cleaning, Gutter Clean, Conservatory, etc. This is displayed on the job screen so you can see what needs to be done.</p><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/bbb3d3e805e27a924bea98d0795701e4.png" alt="bbb3d3e805e27a924bea98d0795701e4.png" /></p>Now you can set the price of the job. If you need to add a price for VAT you can enable the extra VAT fields in the account setting screen. You can also change the currency.<p></p><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/3c2e4eef2c957c77e2046e6ccfaad6f0.png" alt="3c2e4eef2c957c77e2046e6ccfaad6f0.png" /></p>You can then set up how the job will be scheduled. Use the slider to set the number of weeks or you can use the tab to view more options such as monthly and yearly. You can also set the job to be scheduled for a particular day of the week. If you select Working Days you can customise which days you will be working on from the customise section under the Account drop down navigation menu. A preferred time is not required but useful if you need to do that job at a particular time of the day. Once you are done you can press <b>Schedule Job</b> to create the job.<p></p><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/22d097ae470654a759ae4d70475aaa9e.png" alt="22d097ae470654a759ae4d70475aaa9e.png" /></p><h3>Viewing Customers</h3><div>You can view your customer by pressing their name or address on the customer/job/payment listings.</div><div><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/6f8f25a03dd1aecab9073b1281d86245.png" alt="6f8f25a03dd1aecab9073b1281d86245.png" /></p>There are multiple options displayed underneath the customer details.
