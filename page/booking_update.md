## Adding Job
<p></p><p>To add a new job go to the <b>customer list</b> and press the customer name to view the customer. If the customer has an address you will see a <b>New Job</b> button. Select the address and you will be taken to the job creation screen.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/2bb2d51e6adebef725c3609072edc2e0.png" style="width:574.7897196261682px;height:337px;" alt="2bb2d51e6adebef725c3609072edc2e0.png" /></p><h2>Updating Job</h2><div>You can update the job frequency and price by pressing the button on the edit screen.</div><div><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/eed9ee889ee6b12ff33ad6de1dac0c31.png" alt="eed9ee889ee6b12ff33ad6de1dac0c31.png" /></p></div><h3>Job Details Form</h3><p>There are a few fields to complete when adding a new job. First start by setting the job type. This can be anything you want such as Window Cleaning, Gutter Clean, Conservatory, etc. This is displayed on the job screen so you can see what needs to be done.</p><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/bbb3d3e805e27a924bea98d0795701e4.png" alt="bbb3d3e805e27a924bea98d0795701e4.png" /></p>Now you can set the price of the job. If you need to add a price for VAT you can enable the extra VAT fields in the account setting screen. You can also change the currency.<p></p><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/3c2e4eef2c957c77e2046e6ccfaad6f0.png" alt="3c2e4eef2c957c77e2046e6ccfaad6f0.png" /></p>You can then set up how the job will be scheduled. Use the slider to set the number of weeks or you can use the tab to view more options such as monthly and yearly. You can also set the job to be scheduled for a particular day of the week. If you select Working Days you can customise which days you will be working on from the customise section under the Account drop down navigation menu. A preferred time is not required but useful if you need to do that job at a particular time of the day. Once you are done you can press <b>Schedule Job</b> to create the job.<p></p><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/22d097ae470654a759ae4d70475aaa9e.png" alt="22d097ae470654a759ae4d70475aaa9e.png" /></p><h3>Updating Future Jobs</h3><div>If you want to increase the price for a job you can use the check box to apply your price to all future jobs as well as the current job.</div><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/fae84479505e69b5795e2bd24af2d360.png" alt="fae84479505e69b5795e2bd24af2d360.png" /></p><h3>One of Price</h3><div>You can set the price as a one off for the job by setting the new price but leave the checkbox unchecked</div><div><p></p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/34ec8a620e69f67d401a1c0a1ff0ed7d.png" alt="34ec8a620e69f67d401a1c0a1ff0ed7d.png" /></p><br /><br /></div><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h3><br /></h3>
