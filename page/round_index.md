# Rounds

<p></p><p>Rounds allows you to organise your work in much simpler way by segmenting it. You can create as many rounds as you want and add customers to as many rounds as you want. For example, you can create a round for commerical or domestic work or you can create a round for a particular area.</p><p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:24px;font-weight:bold;line-height:30px;">Creating Rounds</span><br /></p><p>You can create a new round simply by pressing the <b>New Round</b> button.
