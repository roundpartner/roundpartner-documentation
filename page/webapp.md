# Offline Mobile Web App

<p>We have released a new mobile app that lets you manage your work even when you have limited or no Internet connectivity. Really useful if you work in an area where 3G is not available all the time.</p><p>Our new Web App is currently in Beta but you can test it right now. The functionality is currently restricted but we plan to release a lot of new features to make it even better.</p><h3>How The New App works</h3><p></p><p>Our new web app is very simple. When you download it onto your mobile you just need to select the <b>synchronise</b> option on the home page. You may need to repeat the login process (don't worry, the app will automatically remember your details for when you next synchronise). When you have successfully logged in, press <b>synchronise</b> button again and it will download your jobs that are scheduled as incomplete and unpaid.</p><p>You can now use the rest of the app without the need of an Internet connection. You can view jobs and mark them as complete. Soon we will be adding more functionality so you can add payments, extras and many other features available on our desktop application.</p><p>At the end of the day you can then upload your work back to your RoundPartner account by pressing <b>synchronise </b>again. The jobs you marked as paid and complete will then be automatically updated and rescheduled for you.</p><p></p><h3>How To Get The App</h3><p></p><p>The easiest way to view the app is to scan this QR code below. By using the Bookmark or Add it option on your device this will add an icon to your home screen making it easier for you to access RoundPartner automatically.</p><p><img src="/uploads/redactor/pages/4ae62e33fd90cca56299df8a88f9c637.png" style="width:137px;height:137px;" alt="4ae62e33fd90cca56299df8a88f9c637.png" /></p>Or you can go to <a href="https://roundpartner.co.uk/webapp">roundpartner.co.uk/webapp</a> on your mobile browser or tablet device.<p><br /></p><h3>Synchronising Your Work</h3><div>The synchronisation option on the home page will automatically detect if you have Internet connectivity. If Internet is available then it will upload your completed and paid jobs for you. It will then download your updated remaining work. It may take from a couple of seconds to a minute depending on your Internet connection speed. For larger rounds the synchronisation feature can use up to and over 1MB of Internet data.<p></p><p></p><h3>A Few Pictures</h3><p>Our new app looks very similar to our online app that you get when visiting our website on a mobile. A synchronise button is found on the home page which downloads your work from your account.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>
